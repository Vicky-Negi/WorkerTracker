## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.


# Setting Up Development Environment

## 1. Download and Install Git
## 2. Update Environment Path
   - Add `/bin` and `/cmd` inside the GitHub folder in `C:\Program Files\Git` to the system's environment PATH variable.

## 3. Flutter SDK Installation
   - Download the Flutter SDK from [Flutter's official installation page](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and extract it to the `C:\flutter` directory.
   - Update the system's environment PATH variable with the `/bin` of the Flutter installation path, i.e., `C:\flutter\bin`.
   - Verify the installation by running `flutter doctor` command. If not working, check the setup.

## 4. Git Path Configuration in Visual Studio Code
   - If Git is not detected automatically, add the path to the Git executable in Visual Studio Code settings.
   - Navigate to File → Preferences → Settings and add the Git path:
     ```json
     {
       "git.enabled": true,
       "git.path": "C:\\path\\to\\git.exe",
       // Other settings
     }
     ```
     Replace the path with your Git installation directory.

## 5. Android Studio Setup
   - Download and install Android Studio.
   - Install Android SDK command line tools during the installation process.
   - From the Virtual Device Manager in Android Studio, install an Android emulator.

## 6. Flutter Doctor for Additional Installations
   - Run `flutter doctor` again. Follow the instructions provided by the command to install any further tools or dependencies.

## 7. Repository Setup in VSCode
   - Clone the repository in Visual Studio Code using Git integration or terminal commands.
   - Run the `main.dart` file after opening the Flutter project in VSCode.
