## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.


# Setting Up Development Environment

## 1. Git Installation
- Download Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Install Git and set the path to `C:\Program Files\Git`.

## 2. Flutter SDK Setup
- Download the Flutter SDK from [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and extract it to `C:\flutter`.
- Update the system's environment variables (`PATH`) with the Flutter `bin` folder: `C:\flutter\bin`.
- Check if Flutter is correctly installed by running `flutter doctor` in the terminal.

## 3. Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Configuration
- If Git is not automatically detected by VSCode, configure the path manually.
- Open VSCode and navigate to File → Preferences → Settings.
- Set the Git path in VSCode settings:
  ```json
  {
    "git.enabled": true,
    "git.path": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe"
    }
